# python-learning-exercises

**By:** Bernard Llanos

**Project started:** January 27, 2015

## Description

This is a collection of short Python programs created while learning Python.

Most programs are exercises from the following resources:

- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/), by Zed A. Shaw, 3rd Edition
  - Programs are located in `./learnPythonTheHardWay`

The primary reason this repository is on GitHub is because I wanted to access the code
from multiple computers.
