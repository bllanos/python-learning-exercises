# Finding something to calculate

print "Integer vs. floating point division:"
print "1 / 4 = ", 1 / 4
print "1.0 / 4.0 = ", 1.0 / 4.0
print "1 / 4.0 = ", 1 / 4.0
print "1.0 / 4 = ", 1.0 / 4
print "7 / 4 = ", 7 / 4
# Results: Casting seems similar to C++
# Only '1 / 4' results in integer division.

print "In C++, '^' is bitwise XOR."
print "In Python, 2 ^ 4 =", 2 ^ 4 # = 6
print "and 5 ^ 3 =", 5 ^ 3,"," # 6
print "so it is also bitwise XOR."
